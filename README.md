# pharma-sentiment
Originally wanted to use Twitter data to see how sentiments around pharma in general and specific pharma companies have changed over the course of the pandemic -- however, due to issues with the scraping tool (couldn't scrape futher than 1 week in the past), I've shifted geards a little bit. Instead, have looked at specific pharma companies sentiments over the past week and how well they correlate with stock prices.

I've started with Pfizer and acheived some pretty interesting results, so plan to add more in the future.
